# The-Knight-s-Tour
Designed and implemented a recursive brute-force algorithm in C++ to solve the Knight's Tour problem on an n x n chessboard, with 'n' provided by user input.  Developed a program that guides a knight to visit every square on the chessboard exactly once, and outputs a complete solution on the screen.
