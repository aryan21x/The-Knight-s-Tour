# The-Knight-s-Tour
This program offers a flexible solution to the classic Knight's Tour problem by accepting one or two command-line arguments. With a single argument, it presents the user with three options: modifying the default board size or starting position or finding a knight's tour solution starting from the specified row and column on a user-defined chessboard. Alternatively, when supplied with a second file-based argument containing size, row, and column values, the program generates and names multiple knight's tour solutions on chessboards of the given size, starting from different positions. The core of the program relies on a recursive algorithm and dynamic memory allocation to find knight's tour solutions, with the output presented on the screen or saved in a file based on the input arguments.
